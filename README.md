# COMP379_March_Madness_Predictor

## Addressed Problem Details and Motivation 

The project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of the NCAA March Madness basketball games. With data spanning the last 15 years of March Madness statistics, the goal is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting game winners. The motivation behind this project was each of our interests and the immense popularity surrounding March Madness. Predicting game outcomes could have significant implications for basketball fans, bettors, and sports analysts.
